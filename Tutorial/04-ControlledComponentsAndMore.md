* Other useful ideas:

    * Conditional rendering: `&&` and `?` for `if` and `if...else` behavior
    * Controlled components: Link `onChange` to state via a handler function; value equal to value in state


* Planning concepts:

    * Component structure and file paths
    * Where will state be held?
    * Router vs. pure single-page app
